# Udacity - Deep Learning Nanodegree
Hi this repo stores my path in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. Most of the projects are done using Jupyter notebooks and reflects all modules that Ipass through the course.

Following a brief description abou the projects that I've done

## Project 1 - Bike Sharing 
In this project I've build a simple neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership.  
The concepts addressed was:  
- Loading data  
- Scaling data  
- Splitting data into Training, Test and Validation
- Building the Neural Network only with Numpy
- Implementing back and forward propagation
- Implementing Gradient Descent
